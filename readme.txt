first creat frontend and backend folder. in the frontend folder download vite and npm i react-router-dom react-hot-toast,tailwind, -D daisyui@latest and add this daisyui in tailwind plugins then move to backend folder and start working on backend first.
download node(npm init) and eexpress,mongoose,dotenv jsonwebtoken bcrptjs cookie parser cloudinary socket.io
Breakdown of Packages:
express: Web framework for Node.js
mongoose: MongoDB ODM (Object Data Modeling)
dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file
jsonwebtoken: For generating and verifying JWT tokens
bcryptjs: For hashing and comparing passwords
cookie-parser: For parsing cookies
cloudinary: For uploading and managing media on Cloudinary
socket.io: For real-time, bi-directional communication

since the frontend folder has src folder and all the working files like index.js are into it so we will also create a src folder in the backend and put index.js and all the folders like mvc in it and also we will use module like import express from 'express' not const express because in frontend vite is using the import(firstly in package.json write type as module instead of commonjs)

when a file exports something using export default, you can import it using any name you like. For example, in your auth.route.js file, if you're exporting the router with export default router;, then in your index.js, you can import it using any identifier, such as import authRoutes from './routes/auth.route.js';, or even import abc from './routes/auth.route.js';. Both will work perfectly because you're importing the default export, and JavaScript allows you to rename default imports as you wish. However, it‚Äôs a good practice to use meaningful names like authRoutes to make the code more readable and understandable. 
after writing the code of router, go to mongodb website and create a new project (email-yashikaathakkar) and get the passcode and paste in .env 
to access env variables in index.js you need to use 2 lines 1st import dotenv from "dotenv" and dotenv.config()
place .env outside the src
when pasting the password of mongodb in the .env make sure to write the dababase name before ?

if we are exporting like this ( export const user= "") then for importing write import {user} from ... but if you are exporting like (const user="" then export default user) then import like import user from ...

In the signup process, when a user enters their full name, email, and password and clicks the signup button, the data is sent to the backend. Before storing the user's password in the database, it is first hashed using bcrypt to ensure security. Only the hashed version of the password is saved in the database‚Äînot the plain text. After the user is successfully created, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is generated to authenticate the session. This token is then sent back to the user's browser via a secure cookie, allowing the user to remain logged in.

In the login process, when the user submits their email and password by clicking the login button, the server fetches the user data from the database using the provided email. The plain password entered by the user is then compared to the hashed password stored in the database using bcrypt. If the comparison is successful, meaning the password is correct, a new JWT token is generated and sent back to the user's browser in a cookie. This token is used for verifying the user's identity in future requests without requiring them to log in again.

the profile will allow user to update profile pic only not full name and email. profile pic will only be updated if the user is authenticated means if the user has signup or login so we will use protectroute middleware before updating profile to check whether the user is authenticatwd or not.
The `protectRoute` middleware is used to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain routes. It first checks if a token is present in the request cookies. If the token is missing, it responds with a 401 Unauthorized error. Then, it verifies the token using the secret key from the environment variables. If the token is invalid, it responds with another 401 error. If the token is valid, it decodes the token to get the user's ID, and uses that to find the user in the database. If the user exists, it attaches the user object to the `req` object, so that the route handler can access the user's details. If any issues occur, such as no token, invalid token, or user not found, the middleware sends an appropriate error message. The goal is to ensure that only valid, authenticated users can proceed with the requested operation.
On the other hand, the checkAuth controller is a route handler that comes after protectRoute. Its job is simple‚Äîit just sends back the authenticated user‚Äôs information that protectRoute already attached to req.user. This is typically used to check whether the user is logged in when the frontend app loads or refreshes.
In short, protectRoute handles authentication (verifying the user), while checkAuth handles authorization (sending back the user data if authenticated). Without protectRoute, checkAuth wouldn't have access to req.user, and without checkAuth, there would be no route logic to actually respond with that user data.
to update the profile we will use cloudinary.com and get cloud name from dashboard and paste in .env


To make the updateprofilecontroller first step is to npm install cloudinary then update .env with cloudinary name,api,secret key and they import all of them in cloundnary.js file in lib and step import that function in controller.

getusersforsidebar explanation- The `getUsersForSidebar` function is a controller that retrieves a list of all users except the currently logged-in user. This is useful in a chat application where the user should see other people they can chat with, not themselves. When a user is logged in, their ID (`req.user._id`) is obtained from the request object (thanks to authentication middleware). The function then queries the database using `User.find()` to get all users whose ID is not equal to the logged-in user‚Äôs ID, using the MongoDB `$ne` (not equal) operator. Additionally, the `.select("-password")` part ensures that the password field is excluded from the returned user data for security. Finally, the list of filtered users is sent back as a JSON response to be shown, for example, on the left sidebar of a chat interface. If there's any error during the process, it responds with a 500 status and an error message.

getmessage and sendmessage controllers:
Imagine User A sends a message to User B:
sendMessage will store that message in the database and emit it live to User B if they're online.
Later, when either user opens the chat, getMessages will fetch all past messages between A and B.

üîπ getMessages Controller:
The getMessages function is responsible for retrieving all previous messages exchanged between two users. It begins by extracting the ID of the user to chat with (userToChatId) from the request parameters and the logged-in user‚Äôs ID (myId) from the authenticated request object (req.user). Using Mongoose, it queries the Message collection in the database to find any messages where either the sender is the logged-in user and the receiver is the other user, or vice versa. This is done using the $or operator to match both message directions. Once the messages are found, they are returned in the response with a status code of 200. This controller is typically used when a user opens a chat to load the conversation history between themselves and the other user.

üîπ sendMessage Controller:
The sendMessage function handles sending a new message from one user to another. It extracts the message content (text, and optional image) from the request body, and the recipient‚Äôs ID from the request parameters. The sender‚Äôs ID is obtained from the authenticated user object. If there‚Äôs an image, it is uploaded to Cloudinary, and the secure URL is stored. A new Message document is then created with the sender ID, receiver ID, message text, and the image URL (if present), and saved to the database. After saving, the function checks if the recipient is currently connected via Socket.io (using getReceiverSocketId) and, if they are, sends the new message to them in real time using io.to().emit(). Finally, the function responds with the newly created message and a status code of 201, confirming successful delivery and storage.

in backend :
Till now, in the backend of your chat application, you‚Äôve built a solid foundation that enables secure user authentication and real-time messaging. You've implemented routes and controllers for user signup, login, logout, and profile update, all protected by middleware that checks for a valid JWT token (`protectRoute`). You also created the `checkAuth` controller to verify if a user is authenticated. For the chat functionality, you've built endpoints like `getUsersForSidebar` which fetches all users except the logged-in one‚Äîuseful for displaying a sidebar of available users to chat with. You also developed the `getMessages` controller to retrieve full conversation history between two users, and the `sendMessage` controller which not only saves messages to the database (including optional images via Cloudinary) but also emits new messages in real-time using Socket.io if the recipient is online. All these pieces together form the backend engine that powers user management and dynamic messaging in your chat application.

in frontend start with app.jsx write rfce and enter
download axios and zustand and then initialize axios in lib folder
toast is used for showing pop up messages like toast.success,toast.error and toast.loading
we need to define user authentication code,profile pic updation login signup both in frontend and backend like in backend we write code for user authentication using cookie jwt and pfp update using cloudinary and in frontend we use zustand

üîÅ Flow Example
User logs in ‚Üí frontend sends credentials to backend

Backend verifies user ‚Üí sends user data + sets a cookie

Frontend stores user data in Zustand ‚Üí uses it for UI & socket connection

Data is already stored in MongoDB from signup

created a sidebar and sidebarskeleton. sidebar is a vertical left panel that shows a list of users (contacts), lets you select someone to chat with, and includes a toggle to show only online users. and after that all the contacts will be visible but while the sidebar is loading you will see the sidebarskeleton ie the visual representation of the sidebar which will be seen when the sidebar is still loading.

When User A sends "Hi" to User B:
Frontend ‚Üí Sends message via API or Socket to backend.
Backend ‚Üí Stores the message in MongoDB.
Backend ‚Üí Emits message to User B via Socket.IO.
Frontend (User B) ‚Üí Receives message and shows it.


After setting up Socket.IO on the frontend to handle real-time messaging, it is essential to also configure a Socket.IO server in socket.js file in the backend. This server acts as the central hub that manages and maintains all WebSocket connections between users. When a user connects to the application, the frontend sends their userId to the backend, which then maps that user to their unique socket connection. The backend server listens for events like user connection, disconnection, or message delivery, and broadcasts updates (such as the list of online users) to all connected clients. It ensures that messages are sent instantly and securely from one user to another by identifying their active socket ID and emitting the event directly to that socket. Without this backend server, real-time features like showing online users or delivering messages live would not work. The backend plays a critical role in enabling secure, efficient, and scalable real-time communication between users.



to connect both frontend and backend you need to 
1. Backend Setup (index.js in your backend folder)

// Import necessary modules
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();

// CORS configuration to allow requests from the frontend (development)
app.use(cors({
    origin: "http://localhost:5173", // Frontend URL in development       //this is frotnend port
    credentials: true, // Allow credentials (cookies) to be sent
}));

// Middleware to serve static files in production
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    // Serve static files from the frontend dist folder
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../frontend/dist")));

    // Redirect all requests to index.html for SPA routing
    app.get("*", (req, res) => {
        res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../frontend", "dist", "index.html"));
    });
}

// Your API routes
app.get('/api/some-endpoint', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Hello from backend!' });
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});


2. Frontend Setup (axios.js in the frontend folder)

// Import axios for making API requests
import axios from "axios";

// Create an axios instance with dynamic base URL
export const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.MODE === "development" ? "http://localhost:3000/api" : "/api",   //this is backend port
  withCredentials: true, // Ensure that cookies are sent with requests
});
